### General
* Example of a simple web app using the Grails Framework, this framework is based on the Java Language and Groovy to create a web app or [plugins](https://plugins.grails.org/) in a simple and fast way, thanks to the Integration with many other technologies and code generation, Grails generates the code of the view layers, controller and services, speeding up the initialization of these layers in the project, in turn generating a much faster and more agile connection with the data layer to use.

###Demo
* Check out the demo at https://grailsapp.tk/

The demo is a simple web app hosted on an EC2 instance of [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com/) generated by Grails with connection to a mysql database on [Amazon RDS](https:/ /aws.amazon.com/es/rds/) you can test login, the login user is user: user@user.com - password: 1, in turn you can create, edit, consult and delete users, students and notes and assign them to a created student.
